### What this aims to do
This project aims to address the question of how a retailer should target a promotion campign in order to maximise purchase of the promoted product and net revenue.

### What data I use
The data I work with here is taken from a take-home exercise issued to data scientist candidates by starbucks. We data on approx. 83,000 individuals the following variables:
- Whether they received a promotion
- Whether they purchased the product
- 7 abstract explanatory variables that are just labelled V1-V7
### What approach I take
